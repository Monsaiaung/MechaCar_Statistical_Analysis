## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

![LinearRegression](https://github.com/Monsaiaung/MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis/blob/4a0b8a0038125c31eea422d8b3c85a75786ead06/Images/2.png)

Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?

The vehicle_length and ground_clearance have a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values since their p-Values are less than 0.05. These two coefficients have statistically significant impact on predicting mpg. Whereas, the vehicle weight, spoiler angle, and AWD have p-values that shows a random amount of variance with the dataset.

Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?

Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
